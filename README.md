# Bobthething
Bob the Thing is the first of its kind stress reliever made with SwiftUI. Click or tap him to make him do weird stuff. This project was originally fluffy-brocolli, which is now archived and read-only. To use, load in Xcode, Swift Playgrounds or a similar Swift IDE with a viewer. FEEL FREE TO HELP A CODER OUT BY EDITING ANY ERRORS U SEE! Just dont purposefully add errors (just saying).
